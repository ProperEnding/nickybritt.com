			Nicky Britt is an organizer of people. He was the lead for a AAA mobile and desktop video game, marketed indie musicians, assisted in the pre-production of feature films, and repurposed a 16 story high-rise. He is a successful communicator, ensuring film funding from financial providers, while training testers in the QA department. As a self-teacher he has learned guitar, web development, and was a diamond level Starcraft 2 player. He has landed trout in Montana, eaten pierogi in Poland, and drank scotch in Scotland. He is a pixel alchemist, student of strategy, and master of the scientific method. He has been called: Bicycle Theft Detective, Sharp-Dressing Nerf Herder, Cohen Brothers Evangelist, Le Corbousier of blanket forts, and The F-150 of friendship. He prefers the Dothraki to the Bravosi for the same reason he chose Magnum PI over Nightrider.
